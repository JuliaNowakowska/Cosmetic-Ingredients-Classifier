# Cosmetic Ingredients Classifier

### Overview
This project is designed to extract and preprocess a list of ingredients from an image of a cosmetic product's packaging. The project uses the Python Imaging Library to preprocess the image and pytesseract to extract text. The extracted text is then cleaned and converted into a list of ingredients.

### Future plans
- Classification of the cosmetic based on the ingredients extracted from the picture.
- GUI
